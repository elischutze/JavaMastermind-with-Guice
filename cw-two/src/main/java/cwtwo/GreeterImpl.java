					+ "\n- A color may appear more than once in the code."
					+ "\n- You try to guess what colored pegs are in the code and what order they are in."
					+ "\n- After making a guess the result will be displayed.\n"
					+ "- A result consists of a black peg for each peg you have exactly correct (color and position) in your guess."
					+ "\n- For each peg in the guess that is the correct color, but is out of position, you get a white peg."
					+ "\n- Only the first letter of the color is displayed. B for Blue, R for Red, and so forth."
					+ "\n- When entering guesses you only need to enter the first character of the color as a capital letter."
					+ "\n"
					+ "\nYou have " + turns + " turns to guess the answer or you lose the game. Good Luck!";
